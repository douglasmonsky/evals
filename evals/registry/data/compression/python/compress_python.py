Include information about classes, functions, and methods that are not part of the standard library, that one would
need to know to reasonably be able to create accurate and comprehensive documentation for the provided code.

For example, if the code uses a custom class, include the class definition and a brief description of its purpose.

compressor.compress
take an input string and a compression algorithm, apply said algorithm and return the compressed string.

Potential builtins to use in development:
